    Let n be the number to factorize and q = E (\sqrt{N}). The idea is to find a and b such that n = a^2 - b^2 then N = (a+b)(ab) and if a exists then a \geqslant q + 1. We successively choose a = q + 1, a = q + 2, a = q + 3,â€¦ until there is an a such that a^2 - N is a square. If we find a decomposition as a difference of two squares, in other words if N = a^2 - b^2 then, a \geqslant E (\sqrt {N})+1 where E (\sqrt{N}) is the integer part of \sqrt{N}.
